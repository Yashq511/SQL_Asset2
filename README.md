ðŸ’» Tasks Performed: : Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Practice inserting, updating, and deleting data.

Created a table emp_1 with fields like:

emp_id (auto-incremented primary key),
employee_name (required),
position, department, age, hire_date, salary.
Applied constraints:

NOT NULL â€“ name canâ€™t be empty
CHECK (age >= 18) â€“ to ensure valid age. 

DEFAULT â€“ for missing email addresses.

Inserted data using INSERT INTO for multiple employees.

Updated data: changed age for a specific employee.

Deleted data: removed one employee record using DELETE.

Handled NULLs: added a new column email with a default value if email is not provided.

Tested Constraints:
Tried inserting an underage employee (age < 18) â†’ failed as expected.
Tried inserting NULL into employee_name â†’ failed due to NOT NULL.
